/* THEME A - Q4 : Acquisition then run - installer / archive / script written to a
   user-writable path, and then EXECUTED from that same path.
   Purpose : detection
   Dataset : xdr_data (FILE joined to PROCESS)
   Idea    : KOI will eventually inventory whatever the installer leaves behind, but only at
             the next scan. The write-then-execute pair is the moment of acquisition and it is
             visible in XDR immediately.
   Live ground truth: chrome.exe wrote C:\Users\amahmoud\Downloads\Antigravity-x64.exe, which
   was then run, and KOI reported "Antigravity 2.3.1" on win-workstation afterwards.
   Join note: after `join ... as run`, joined columns are referenced by their BARE names. */
