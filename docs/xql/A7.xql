/* THEME A - Q7 : KOI SCAN FRESHNESS measured from XDR, not from KOI.
   Purpose : detection (coverage assurance) + investigation (is this host's inventory stale?)
   Dataset : xdr_data (PROCESS) only - no KOI data needed, which is the point.
   Why     : KOI on Windows is run-on-demand; there is no resident agent, so ABSENCE of KOI
             events means "no scan ran", not "nothing happened". You cannot tell those apart
             from koi_koi_raw. But the KOI agent bundles its own Python and executes as
             C:\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Koi\Python\WPy64-*\python\python.exe -I <tmp>.pyz
             spawned by powershell.exe - which XDR records. So XDR can tell you WHEN a host was
             last scanned, and therefore how much to trust its KOI inventory.
   Verified on this tenant: win-workstation, scans at 09:45:22, 09:51:15 and 10:00:10 line up
   exactly with the manually triggered scans.
   Use as a detection by filtering minutes_since_last_scan above your tolerance. */
