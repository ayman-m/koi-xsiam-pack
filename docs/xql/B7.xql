// Theme B / B7 - KOI's MCP server inventory, deduplicated, with its risk verdict.
// KOI does not ship MCP servers as their own event type. They arrive as an `mcp` RESOURCE
// inside an OCSF-ish alert: resources[0] is the MCP server, resources[1] is the device.
// CRITICAL: the integration re-sends every still-open alert on each 1-minute fetch cycle
// (~245x duplication over 24h). Dedupe on metadata.notification_event_id - never count()
// rows, never dedupe on _id. finding_info.uid is the POLICY id, not an alert id.
// Investigation.
