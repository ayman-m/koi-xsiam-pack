// Theme B / B9 - Shadow MCP: an MCP server EXECUTING on an endpoint that KOI has not
// inventoried. KOI is run-on-demand on Windows - no resident agent - so a server installed
// and used between two scans is invisible on the supply-chain side while fully visible in
// endpoint telemetry. This is the coverage-gap detection neither dataset can produce alone.
