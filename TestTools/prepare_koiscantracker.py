"""Produce the single-file (prepared) KoiScanTracker automation for manual upload.

Why this exists
---------------
The official content layout for a Python automation is TWO files — the YAML holds the
metadata with `script: '-'` as a placeholder, and the code lives beside it in the .py.
That split is correct and must stay:

  https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/package-dir

`demisto-sdk upload` assembles them into a unified YAML on the way to the tenant, so a
pack install works from the two-file source with nothing extra to do.

Manual import through the console is the case that needs help: it takes ONE file, and
that file has to be the unified YAML. The supported way to produce it is
`demisto-sdk prepare-content`. This script does the same job in a few lines so someone
without the SDK installed is not blocked — the guide's whole premise is that testing
needs no content development.

Why not just call prepare-content
---------------------------------
Its output was diffed against this one: the metadata and the code are identical except
that the SDK wraps the body in

    register_module_line('KoiScanTracker', 'start', __line__())
    ...
    register_module_line('KoiScanTracker', 'end', __line__())

`register_module_line` is defined in CommonServerPython, and the SDK only inlines that
library into scripts that import it. KoiScanTracker deliberately does not — it is
self-contained so it can be uploaded raw — so the SDK's own output would call a name
that does not exist at runtime, so those two lines are omitted here deliberately.

Output: dist/automation-KoiScanTracker.yml — generated, never edited by hand.

Usage:  python3 TestTools/prepare_koiscantracker.py [--check]
        --check verifies the prepared file matches the source instead of rewriting it.
