"""Produce the single-file (prepared) KoiScanTracker automation for manual upload.

Why this exists
---------------
The official content layout for a Python automation is TWO files — the YAML holds the
metadata with `script: '-'` as a placeholder, and the code lives beside it in the .py.
That split is correct and must stay:

  https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/integrations/package-dir

`demisto-sdk upload` assembles them into a unified YAML on the way to the tenant, so a
pack install works from the two-file source with nothing extra to do.

Manual import through the console is the case that needs help: it takes ONE file, and
that file has to be the unified YAML. The supported way to produce it is
`demisto-sdk prepare-content`. This script does the same job in a few lines so someone
without the SDK installed is not blocked — the guide's whole premise is that testing
needs no content development.

Output: dist/automation-KoiScanTracker.yml — generated, never edited by hand.

Usage:  python3 TestTools/prepare_koiscantracker.py [--check]
        --check verifies the prepared file matches the source instead of rewriting it.
